      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">Registration of the
        Graduands will be from <strong>10 AM on 09/09/2022
          (FRIDAY)</strong>. Registrations
        shall be allowed till <strong>4PM</strong>. All Graduands who wish to receive their degrees in person on the
        Dais should <strong>mandatorily report for
          the rehearsal which is planned on 9th September 2022 at 5 PM</strong>. Registration Desk would be near
        Academic
        Block. Graduands may collect their stoles & other coupons from representatives at the registration desk. Post
        registration, Graduands shall assemble in the Convocation Hall latest by <strong>4.30 PM</strong> for the
        rehearsal.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;"><strong>Attending the
          Rehearsal is mandatory</strong> in view of the procedures such
        as the protocol of
        degree receipt from the Chief Guest, Director and Board members, order in which the graduands movement shall
        happen
        around the stage, etc. Any miss would only alter the highly sequenced process which should happen without
        any announcements during the convocation and end up in confusion with the degree stack. <strong>Graduands who
          fail to attend the rehearsal will not be able to collect the degrees on the Convocation Dais</strong> and may
        collect
        the same from Academic Office after the convocation is over. Rehearsal Protocol is IMPORTANT to ensure
        synchronization with the Degree Stack which would contain the degrees / awards of only registered
        graduands, and any order violation would upset the Degree Stack. Cooperation of graduands is requested in
        this regard.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">Graduands are requested to
        be seated in their allotted chairs (Graduand Name and Roll
        Nos. sticker shall be pasted on the chairs) for the <strong>rehearsal on 9th September (assemble from 4
          PM)</strong> and for the <strong>convocation on
          10th September (assemble from 1PM, latest by 2.15 PM)</strong>. No registered graduands would be allowed to
        enter
        the convocation area after the cutoff time (2.15 PM).</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">All Graduands are
        requested to be dressed Formally befitting the academic occasion as
        listed below. <strong>Stoles will be issued by the Institute</strong> and Graduands should make their

      <h3>DO's & DONT's</h3>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">The Institute Convocation
        is a pious and academic event with established protocol to
        be followed over the
        years. All graduands are requested to cooperate with the institute in making this event a successful one and in
        line with the tradition.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">Graduands are requested
        not to venture out of their seats beyond the cutoff time of
        2.15 PM. You may
        carry water bottles with you if required. In case of any assistance student volunteers around the area may be
        approached.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">As mentioned the event is
        an extremely pious one and hence indiscriminate clapping /
        whistling / shouting
        / howling etc. during the Award of Degrees shall not be entertained. You are our past students and valued
        ALMA matter, hence we desist from the violation clause! Your cooperation in this regard contributes to your
        institute's event success.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">Appreciation in the form
        of gentle clapping for meritorious graduands (awardees)
        during Prize Distribution
        only would be allowed to be in line with the pious nature of the event. We completely appreciate the fact that
        each and every degree recipient is a special one for the institute and all stakeholders. However to maintain the
        tradition and the decorum of the event amidst the esteemed guests inclusive of you and your parents, gentle
        clapping for receipient of Prizes would be allowed.</li>
      <li class="bg-dark text-light p-3 mb-2 border-bottom rounded" style="list-style: none;">You may inform your
        parents /friends not to approach the dais as you receive the
        degree / awards for any
        sort of photography. Institute photography team would be in place and each graduands photo would be
        recorded and passed on by the Administration in soft form after the convocation. It is also requested to pass
        on to your parents and other guests that clapping would be as per our earlier guideline in (4) above.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p class="mb-5 bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded">
        <strong>P.S:</strong> Please do appreciate the fact that this is one of the showcase occasions of the institute
        in the midst of
        external audience such as the Press, Board and Senate members, esteemed Chief Guest, Chairman, Director,
        and distinguished guests and our esteemed guest and; howling / whistling / indiscriminate clapping and other
        forms of disturbances, etc. would present the institute to the external world in a distasteful manner. Hence we
        hope that all graduands would appreciate the guidelines in the right earnest and adhere to them to make the
        event a successful one as a model for subsequent batches to follow.
